## Technical decisions

This project is composed by:

- **Vite** The best approach for this project is to work with Client-side rendering, for this reason, there was no need for Next, Gatsby or other libraries that help with different ways of rendering.

- **Zustand** yes, it seems like a bad decision, but the complexity of a larger state management like *Redux* was not necessary.

- **React router dom** for handle the different routes in our app.

- **Atomic Design** focused on reusability and to compose big components by smaller ones.

- **Custom Hooks** and some **Compound components** were used as pattern design.

- **HTML** in our **JSX** and pure **CSS**

- **Fetch** yep, once again, it was not neccesary add other dependency like **Axios** to our project.
(I builded an interceptor with fetch to handle request headers) üòâ

- **PNPM** as default package manager.

### üìùNOTES
